            <p>The Freightliner Cascadia is a series of heavy-duty semi-trailer trucks produced by Freightliner Trucks.
                As of the 2024 model year, there have been two generations of Cascadia; Generally, these can be referred
                to by their internal model designations (Cascadia125 and Cascadia 126, respectively). <br><br>Its design
                took fuel efficiency into great consideration, as well as having improved upon several other features
                including the powertrain offerings, sound mitigation, safety systems, and overall mechanical reliability
                from its predecessors. It is offered in three basic configurations: Day Cab, Mid-Roof XT, and Raised
                Roof. The latter two models are sleeper cabs, offered in various lengths, ranging from 48 to 72 inches
                (Raised Roof models available for 60” or 72” lengths only). The Cascadia was sold chiefly in North
                America until 2020, when an export, primarily geared towards the Australian and New Zealand markets, was
                introduced. Prior to the introduction of the export variant, its place remained occupied by the
                Freightliner Century (no longer in US production) for export markets. Additional variations include the
                Cascadia 113, which looks nearly identical to the 125, but has a shorter hood and front overhang.
                <br><br>The Cascadia Evolution is a more fuel-efficient version of the Cascadia, released in 2013.
                Improvements were made to both the aerodynamics and the comfort of the driver. The instrument cluster
                was redesigned to be easier to read, the seats have improved back and lumbar support, dashboard switches
                are repositioned with larger, higher contrast text, and a battery-powered auxiliary HVAC system from
                Thermo King was offered. This system was designed to reduce overnight engine idling, both saving fuel
                and reducing noise while drivers are asleep</p>
